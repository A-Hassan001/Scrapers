The problem for me is that I don't make eggs every day. I make a dozen at a time every 7 or 10 days. When I have the pinhole in the egg, it seems that water is drawn in during the cool down, and this immediately starts the egg white on its way to mushy, yucky, almost decomposing and very, very unfriendly and unappetising. I always keep hard boiled eggs in the fridge and that almost seems to make things worse. What as I doing wrong?""}]"

The &quot;chouriço&quot;, &quot;linguiça&quot; or even &quot;paio&quot;, if you want it more meaty (these are three types of Portuguese cured sausages, the third one is very large), onion and garlic are not sizzled in the olive oil. 2. The potatoes are completly smashed, not just partially. 3. It definitely is NOT made with chicken broth! 4. It takes a much larger quantity of &quot;couve galega&quot; (collards) ou &quot;couve portuguesa&quot;, which is very similar. The real Portuguese recipe is made like this: In a large pot, you boil the potatoes and the onion (whole, not minced), then make them into a purée. Add salt to taste (pay atention, because the &quot;chouriço&quot; is normally a bit salty) and three or four large (again whole, not minced) garlic cloves and then boil the collards, which must be minced much thinner than you show. When they are almost cooked, add a generous (or not so generous, it&#x27;s up to your taste) extra virgin olive oil portion; make sure the oil boils only for three or four minutes. Than take some bowls (smaller than ramen bowls; the grey one in the photo is the right size) add a slice or two of raw &quot;chouriço&quot; and pour the soup, very hot, on top of it. Accompany it with slices of &quot;broa&quot; (Portuguese corn bread). The only variation allowed is to boil the &quot;chouriço&quot; (yet again, whole, not sliced) with the potatoes and the onions, take it out before you make the purée, and slice it and add to the bowls, as previously said. If you want to see what it looks like, there are photos on Wikipedia (although it also has a mistake, saying we eat it on festivities like weddings and birthdays; not true: we eat it all year round). One thing you got absolutely right, though: it&#x27;s absolutely delicious (and this tradicional version, much healthier)! Oh!

This information allowed me to get the macaroni just how I like it - almost gooey. Recently, I tried it with bigger macaroni (mentioned above), and while the sauce was exactly right, there wasn\'t enough of it. So I upped the cheese powder to 1/4c (4T), the tapioca starch to 3/4 tsp, and used 1 or 2 T of yogurt, whisking the milk (about 1/4 c) in at the end until it was the desired consistency. For bigger macaroni that might be harder to coat, this gives a nice amount of sauce.\nI double this recipe tonight when 2 very picky nephews came over (kids who don\'t even like fruit) (!!!), and they gave it rave reviews, requesting seconds, and calling it ""even better than the box."" Winner winner cheesy dinner! This is a keeper for sure.'}]"

I am from Canada and grew up in So California. Instead of frying the potatoes, I toss in a mix of olive oil salt and seasonings (varies: parsley, tarragon, Italian herbs, or even zatar) line on a baking sheet and bake until done and browned. I then saute the onions, layer on the potatoes, and yes sometimes some cooked mushrooms as well, then pour over the egg mixture and bake. Recently, as I no longer have a regular oven, but a toaster oven that is not big enough to hold a frying pan, I have been baking in a greased 8x8x2"" pan.
