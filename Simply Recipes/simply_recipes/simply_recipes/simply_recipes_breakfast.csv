Would you suggest I start with cold milk straight to the IP Incubation (Yogt) stage, testing the milk’s temperature and adding starter once it reaches 116 degrees?

My issue, previously was straining through the cheesecloth or the specially designed cloth I bought to strain the yogurt. It took too long and I didn\'t have the space in the refrigerator.\n\nNow, I bought a yogurt strainer from Amazon (Euro Cuisine GY60) which is a bit pricy but it conveniently fits in the refrigerator and my yogurt, the other day, came out absolutely incredible.

He\'s been using the same package of starter for years, and he keeps it in the freezer.
