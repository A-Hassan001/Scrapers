I read this recipe several times, thinking carefully about each step and what it might taste like. I questioned the &quot;custard&quot; portion as it is unlike any homemade custard I have ever made. The deeper into the recipe I got the more I questioned the recipe. I made it exactly according to the recipe, determined to do it exactly as written and give it a chance. About 3/4 through the recipe I started having serious doubts. By the time for me to mix the cooled custard and orzo with the cool whip and fruit I decided to test it before finally mixing everything together by mixing small amounts and tasting. That did it. I threw out the cold custard/orzo mixture as it was awful. The finished product would have been a total waste of the remaining ingredients. I did something else with them that was edible. All I can think of is something was either left out or someone made this recipe up without testing it. Something is very wrong with the recipe. Mixing sugar, flour, fruit juice and egg does not make a good custard. I actually considered using Birds Custard Mix or even Jello pudding but simply decided to mix fruit and cool whip and eat it as a simple, tasty treat. Something that has been done in the south for ages. Don&#x27;t knock it in it&#x27;s simplicity. But do not waste your time trying to make this as it is written as something is missing in the recipe.
